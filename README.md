# cpp-projects

This repository, **cpp-projects**, is a curated collection of C++ projects developed by **Aakar Gupta** ([@aakargupta-coder](https://github.com/aakargupta-coder)) as part of an ongoing learning journey in mastering C++ programming. The projects herein showcase a progressive understanding of C++ concepts, ranging from fundamental syntax to advanced programming techniques.

## Overview

The repository contains a variety of C++ implementations that focus on the application of key programming concepts, including but not limited to:

- Core language features and syntax
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigms such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
- File I/O operations for persistent data handling
- Algorithmic problem-solving
- Advanced topics such as templates, exception handling, and dynamic memory management

These projects are intended for educational purposes and reflect incremental updates as new C++ concepts were explored.

## Project List

1. **Calculator Application**  
   A command-line calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It demonstrates control structures, user input handling, and function usage.

2. **Bank Management System**  
   A simple system that simulates banking operations, including account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. This project showcases object-oriented design principles, file handling for data persistence, and modular programming.

3. **Student Record Management System**  
   A program designed to manage student data, allowing functionalities such as adding, editing, and deleting records. It also generates reports on student performance. This project emphasizes the use of structures (or classes), file operations, and dynamic data management.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aakargupta-coder/cpp-projects.git
```
2. Navigate to the desired project directory:
```bash
cd cpp-projects/[project-name]
```

3. Compile the C++ source code using a compiler of your choice (e.g., g++):
```bash
g++ -o [output-file] [source-file].cpp
```

4. Run the compiled executable:
```bash
./[output-file]
```
